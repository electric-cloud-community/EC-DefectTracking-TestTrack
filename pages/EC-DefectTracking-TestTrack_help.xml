        <p>The EC-DefectTracking-TestTrack plugin enables you to
        create, update, and link defects to an ElectricFlow job. It

        TestTrack server about what was linked, updated, or
        created.</p>

            <p>Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that
            apply across some or all of the plugin's procedures.
            They are intended to reduce repetition of common
            values, create predefined sets of parameters for end
            users, and to securely store credentials where needed.
            Each configuration is given a unique name that is
            entered in designated parameters on procedures that use
            them.<br />
             Plugin configurations are created by going to the
            ElectricFlow "Administration" tab, then to the
            "Defect Tracking" sub-tab where is the configuration
            panel.</p>
